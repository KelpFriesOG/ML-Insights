    "As dicussed prior, the primary difference between a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a fully connected multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network lies in how the input data is encoded into the network.\n",

    "- MLPs treat input features as independent and flat, losing information about spatial relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CNNs preserve and exploit the locality of 2D input data**\n",
    " (such as images), enabling the network to learn spatial hierarchies of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is particularly powerful for understanding and preserving the locality of 2D input data (i.e. images).\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs are basically stacked layers of pattern matching where the process of pattern matching is based on *kernels* which act as trainable weighted sum functions (similar to the role of a perceptron) that sweep in *patches* across the image.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Each kernel does not map a completely disjoint patch, each patch has some overlap with the prior and next convolution after it.\n",
    "- The kernel moves or *strides* one pixel at a time and moves to the right and then down. \n",
    "- - Therefore we say that the **stride of this kernel's application is 1**.\n",
    "- If the stride of the kernel was *3* then the kernel's convolutions would produce completely disjoint (non-overlapping) patches but this could result in a kernel potentially going out of bounds of the image **unless we add some padding to the image that prevents this**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A stride of 1 ensures that the kernel covers the image densely, without skipping positions, and without risking incomplete patches at the edges (assuming appropriate padding is applied).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming square kernels and a square input image we can actually use a formula to compute the dimensions of the feature map produced by the kernel:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{feature map size} = \\lfloor\\frac{\\text{input size} + 2 \\cdot \\text{padding} - \\text{kernel size}}{\\text{stride}}\\rfloor$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*note the floor operation performed to the fraction*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The padding here is how many pixels are applied as padding to all sides of the image.**\n",
    "\n",
    "And by size we mean the length or height of the respective item (which should be identical since we assume everything is a square).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **While it may be tempting to rearrange the formula such that it solves for stride, this isn't necessarily helpful.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We could solve for stride as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{stride} = \\frac{\\text{input size} + 2 \\cdot \\text{padding} - \\text{kernel size}}{\\text{feature map size} - 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- One issue is that sometimes this formula will end up giving you a fractional value for the stride which is not possible since a \"partial pixel\" is not attainable nor useable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we know all the following and want to calculate stride\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input size = 7\n",
    "- Kernel size = 3\n",
    "- (desired) Output size = 4\n",
    "- Padding = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{stride} = \\frac{7 + 2 \\cdot 0 - 3}{4 - 1} = 1.333$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are several potential solutions in this case:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add some padding\n",
    "- Change the kernel size\n",
    "- Change the desired output size\n",
    "\n",
    "Or another solution, which is more mathematically involved, would be **transposed convolution** which we will not cover here.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we actually toss data into the models, **kernels in the same level of the neural network (i.e. adjacent kernels) are independent of each other**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kernels act on the same underlying input but act as different lenses and filters on the data.\n",
    "- Since they are computed independently, **kernels on the same layer are convoluted in parallel on the same input data.**\n",
    "- This is why GPUs are so useful, they have thousands of tiny computing cores that can be delegated to compute kernels in parallel with a massive amount of data throughput!\n",
    "\n",
    "A **smaller stride (such as 1) maximizes the resolution of the feature map by ensuring that every possible local pattern is examined with significant overlap.** This overlap allows the network to build a detailed and high-resolution representation of the spatial relationships in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In contrast, a larger stride skips positions, reducing overlap and producing a coarser and lower-resolution summary of the input as evident in the smaller feature maps produed as a result."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Alternatively we could apply **average pooling** to reduce each patch into the average of it's values. Note that this value is not supposed to directly represent a pixel, therefore it is perfectly okay for it to be fractional.\n",

    "## Classification: Interpreting High Level Features\n",
    "\n",
    "After we generate the high level features as part of the feature learning process we have yet to accomplish our end goal: classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We want to know if a particular concept (ex. car, dog, airplane, e.t.c) is a subject of the image (in other words we want to deduce the likelihood of potential subjects).\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how to do this we can take a look at our prior MNIST model for some guidance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class SimpleNN(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):\n",
    "        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()\n",
    "        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)\n",
    "        self.relu = nn.ReLU()\n",
    "        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def forward(self, x):\n",
    "        x = self.fc1(x)\n",
    "        x = self.relu(x)\n",
    "        x = self.fc2(x)\n",
    "        return x\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's right, after all is said and done, we still need to take the features generated by the last layer of our feature learning pipeline and flatten it to fit into a fully connected linear layer!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve extracted, say, 16 maps of size 7×7. To treat these as inputs to a standard dense layer, we first flatten each 16 by 16 by 7 tensor into a single 1-D vector of length $16 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 7 = 784$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **This singular flattened tensor will encode the presence of each feature in each feature map as a linear array.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We take that 784-dim vector and **pass it through a dense layer** (or two)… just like in our MNIST example.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should ask yourself: Doesn't flattening contradict the benefits of the feature extraction pipeline (preserving locality while extracting insights on the data)?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    By the time we flatten, we’ve already encoded the important local relationships into our feature values.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Early layers detect local patterns (edges, corners) in specific neighborhoods.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Deeper layers combine those into more abstract motifs (textures, parts of objects).\n",
    "    When you look at a single activation in your final feature-map stack, it’s already a summary of “what was going on” in a small receptive field of the image. Flattening just lines up those summaries into a vector.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The goal of the dense layers is to now understand which of the distilled features are predictive of each class. Dense layers only need to learn which features matter, not where they were. Classification usually doesn’t care if an edge-detector fired at the top-left or bottom-right of its receptive field—just that it fired strongly somewhere.</li>\n",
    "    <li>After sufficent convolution and pooling, you only care about presence and strength of features, not their exact grid coordinates.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here is an example of what an adaptive classifier could look like in order to process the outputted feature maps from the feature learning process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class CNNClassifier(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, num_feats, hidden_size, num_classes):\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",
    "        # num_feats = num_filters * H_out * W_out\n",
    "        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(num_feats, hidden_size)\n",
    "        self.relu = nn.ReLU()\n",
    "        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)\n",
    "    def forward(self, x):\n",
    "        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)     # flatten\n",
    "        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))    # hidden layer\n",
    "        x = self.fc2(x)               # logits\n",
    "        return x\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly the only issue remains that the output of this fully connected layer will not give us probabilties, instead it will give use an unbounded and unpredictable range of values which need to normalized to convert into probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalizing via Softmax\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code for my MNIST demo you will see the following line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "loss_fn = keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have glossed over logits and loss functions before, it may be benefical to recap these topics to understand what this line is doing!\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in very early lessons, logits are the unnormalized scores output by the final dense layer of our network. They can be any real number, positive or negative, and they don’t need to sum to 1. In our MNIST example, for each image the model outputs a vector of 10 logits, one per digit class (0–9).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of normalizing these values with a **softmax function** before feeding them to the loss function, we simply set the flag *\"from_logits = true\"* to let the `keras` API deal with that conversion before calculating the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **softmax function looks intimidating but is trivial to compute**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\operatorname{P}(y = i | z) = \\operatorname{softmax}(z)_i = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\Sigma_{j=1}^{K}e^{z_i}}$$\n",

    "## Additional Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we're accustomed to the traditional CNN pipeline, we have scratched the surface of an iceberg of techniques that modern CNNs use in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While the fundamental idea and general structure of CNNs is consistent throughout most approaches, several optimizations can be made in any stage of the training loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dropout Layers**: Randomly zero out some features in a feature map to prevent overfitting\n",
    "- **Batch Normalization**: Use the statistical mean and variance across a batch of inputs to normalize the outputs in a feature map before applying ReLU.\n",
    "- **Data Augmentation**: Apply random transformations to input images such as cropping, flipping, or color filters, to ensure that the network learns the concept without relying or being biased in determining classes based on the location or color of features.\n",
    "- **Global Pooling**: Instead of feeding sequential flattened feature maps for classification, we could apply one last pooling layer beforehand to generate a singular value per feature and use those for classification.\n",
    "- **Skip Connections**: We can use a parameter to allow the output from one layer to skip some of the next layers and feed directly as the input for these deeper layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropout Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind using dropout layers is that we seek to randomly zero out the presence of some features in a feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dropout layers act as another form of regularization because they offer a tradeoff between bias and variance similar to L1 and L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = W * x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is the typical weighted sum that describes the main operation conducted prior to applying non-linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply a mask to the inputs as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y=W⋅(M⊙x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $M$ is a mask and $⊙$ is elementwise multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "These layers can be thought of as a mask on top of the inputted feature maps that is applied prior to calculating the activation of the layer.\n",
    "We do not want to apply this technique directly to image data because that would corrupt the actual data in the image itself, **but applying it between convolutional layers or even between fully connected layers that work with the feature maps (not the image data) can be beneficial.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout layers are used to address and prevent the problem of **overfitting** (prevent the model from \"memorizing\" the data):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because downsampling techniques like **strided convolution and pooling already address many overfitting concerns, dropout is rarely applied in the convolutional stack** in modern models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead, dropout layers are more frequently used between fully connected layers since that portion of a CNN is more prone to overfitting without them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each time we pass a training image or batch of images, we are slightly tweaking the network by randomly selecting what neurons to drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- - In essence we are **training slightly different networks with each forward pass**, and we take one simple step at the end to average out the results of training across them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dropout layers can be added between convolutional layers, but are more often used in the classification pipeline, between fully connected dense layers.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of dropout’s random deactivations is automatically compensated for, so that at test time no further adjustments are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If some fraction, **$p$, of the activations are zeroed out randomly in each forward TRAINING pass**, we have to scale up the remaining activations to keep the expected output value in a consistent range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The remaining activations are scaled up by $\\frac{1}{1 - p}$**\n",
    "\n",
    "**During testing, dropout is deactivated, meaning no neurons are dropped**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The scaling that happened during training ensures that the outputs are already calibrated. This means no need for further adjustment at test time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern frameworks like Pytorch and Tensorflow, the **dropout layers automatically behave differently under training and testing environments.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $p = 25\\%$, meaning 25% of the neurons are deactivated in a dropout layer during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- During training, the dropout layer will apply this multiplier to the remaining living neurons: $\\frac{1}{(1 - 0.25)}$\n",
    "- This scale up ensures that the magnitude of the activations remains consistent during training and testing (during which no neurons are deactivated).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**In convolutional layers, applying dropout means zeroing out entire channels (feature maps), not individual neurons within a map.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is sometimes called **spatial dropout or Dropout2d**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Zeroing out entire channels **does not affect dimensionality: the input retains the same number of channels, but some contain only zeros during that pass**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, if the input has 16 channels, **we randomly select entire feature maps to zero out, not individual features within them.**"
