    "## A quick introduction to the theory behind deep learning (and machine learning in general)\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a branch of computer science dedicated to the process of learning from data in such a way\n",
    "that it can be applied to solve new problems via prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion some key tenets of machine learning include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Trash in, trash out**: Good data makes good models that actually provide useful results. There is a whole other branch of computer science that deals with cleaning and preprocessing data, but as an ML engineer you need to be able to understand and apply some of these techniques as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Good models are not necessarily the ones that are the most complex**: Suppose the problem of winning a game of tictactoe. From a human perspective, the model or the sequence of decisions in a simple game of tic-tac-toe are not all that hard to realize, therefore it does not make sense to overanalyze the model and try to optimize it beyond a certain point. However, a game like chess which involves a much more complex decision tree, requires a more complex or 'deep' model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your objective is to find the appropriate model, not the most complex model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Understanding the math is not neccesary to create the model, but it is necessary to engineer it**: If you want to create a model for a relatively common task, there are several resources online that offer plug and play solutions. However, my goal is to examine the math behind deep learning that allows greater analysis of the models and their limitations. **You should be comfortable with linear algebra, basic calculus, and statistics but I will try my best to fill in the gaps where I can.**\n",
    "\n",

    "## Generative Modelling and Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is the more generalized field which is composed of various techniques including: linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some of these techniques, specifically neural networks, fall in to the realm of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The main idea behind deep learning is to create an idea which can correct its own errors through iteration, whereas other forms of machine learning may require human intervention to learn.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result deep learning can be used to identify patterns within a dataset or create new data from existing data. We examine the patterns by looking at the model after it has finished training. Looking a model to understand what it tells us about the dataset requires statistical analysis in the form of graphs, visual matrices, e.t.c.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is considered the goto language for any mathematical/statistical problem that requires coding because of a couple of key features.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Simple syntax**: You can write code in Python akin to natural plain english (no need for types, easy extensibility, e.t.c). This makes understanding the code much easier for a non-technical observer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Statistical libraries**: Python has a rich set of libraries for doing statistical analysis that stick with simple syntax and focus on ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Speed**: People argue that Python is a bad language to use for deployed applications because it is interpreted as opposed to being compiled. (What this means that is Python has to go through one more layer of translation before it becomes assembly (compared to C and its derivatives)), but the Python community has continuously been improving the speed of Python with each new patch and I am of the opinion that for an individual or a small group it is plenty fast for any use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets begin with the setup \n",
    "\n",
    "The code below will automatically install all needed resources :smile: This should take a few minutes with good internet connection."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "For any machine learning task we need certain things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A dataset with several input features and one output feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) A predictive model, such as the linear regression model we've discussed, which utilizes input features to generate output predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) A way of measuring how good our predictions are (e.g. mean squared error).\n",
    "\n",
    "4) An optimization method, such as gradient descent, which adjusts model parameters (weights) systematically to minimize the error function by calculating its gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding gradient descent in depth, we can also conceptualize the gradient ascent algorithm, which is essentially gradient descent applied to maximizing a function instead of minimizing it; this is done by reversing the direction of the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hint: Simply put, the local minima of $f(x)$ are the local maxima of $-f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are variations of gradient descent based on how frequently we update the weights and biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Batch Gradient Descent: The default, what we've already discussed. Updates parameters after evaluating the entire dataset, ensuring stability and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stochastic Gradient Descent: Instead of running through all the data points once and then performing the gradient descent, we can instead run through each data point individually and at random and perform gradient descent once for each data point. This improves speed and stochasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: We can perform gradient descent on a batch of data at once (e.g. 32 data points at once), and ideally we would choose the batches randomly but still go through all the data points. This is a combination of the prior two approaches and is often used as the middle ground for more complex datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To end this off I have a Python program below that combines all of our discussed concepts to show how linear regression adapts to a basic dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in python, when I provide some data in the form of an array: `np.array([1, 2, 3])`, this array is considered to be a row matrix. In order for us to turn this into a true vector, we need to take the transpose of the array: `np.array([1, 2, 3])` by doing `np.array([1, 2, 3]).T`. \n",
